Have working watch and phone playing capabilities

watch plays and resumes when app is re-opened

8 different sounds for watch os

cuts off beginning of sound

ITS A BUG

Migrated to auto generating the buttons

have that working from a built array

definitely better as I just need to populate the array

want to switch that it traverses folder and finds the mp3 and generates the array for Migrated
